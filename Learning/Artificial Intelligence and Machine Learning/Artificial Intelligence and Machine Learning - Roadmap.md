### **Step 2: Python Programming (20%)**
- Master the basics of Python programming, as it's the primary language for AI and ML.
- Learn about data types, variables, loops, conditional statements, and functions in Python.
- Explore libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib for data manipulation and visualization.
### **Step 3: Data Handling (20%)**
- Dive deep into data preprocessing techniques: cleaning, handling missing values, and scaling data.
- Gain proficiency in using Pandas for data manipulation and analysis.
### **Step 4: Supervised Learning (20%)**
- Focus on the core algorithms of supervised learning, such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Support Vector Machines.
- Learn about model training, validation, and hyperparameter tuning.
### **Step 5: Unsupervised Learning (20%)**
- Understand the basics of unsupervised learning and clustering algorithms like K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering.
- Explore dimensionality reduction techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
### **Step 6: Deep Learning (20%)**
- Get an introduction to neural networks and deep learning.
- Learn about popular deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch.
- Study concepts like feedforward neural networks, activation functions, and backpropagation.
### **Step 7: Project Work (20%)**
- Apply your knowledge by working on practical projects. Choose a variety of projects that cover different aspects of AI and ML.
- Implement end-to-end machine learning pipelines, from data preprocessing to model deployment.
- Experiment with real-world datasets and showcase your work in a portfolio.
