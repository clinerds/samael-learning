so scan with nmap found 2 open ports ssh and 80. did'nt got what services are running. scanned dirs with gobuster but did'nt found any open directories. so used whatweb and found the version of apache 2.

looked the version on the internet and found the exploit. got the shell access. 
Now I am stuck

## Improvement notes. 

looked on writups and found they found the version numbers using nmap with some option that I don't know

- so learn nmap better.... found a command that works for you

- Next note is get reverse shell if you got access via a exploit for better feel and experience

- work on your info gather and reconnaissance skills
-
- Organize things and tabs (make directory and putt all in one place)
