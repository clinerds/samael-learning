#Frequencies #Solfeggio #CIA #BinauralBeats 
The ancient Solfeggio scale, known as “Just Intonation”, is renowned for its use in the Gregorian chants, but its history can be traced back to Biblical times. The 6-tone scale, and an additional 3 tones discovered since, is considered by many musicologists and scientists to have a positive effect on the mind and body.

Back in the 11th century, a Benedictine monk named Guido d’Arezzo introduced the musical scale we now know as the Solfeggio frequencies – though modern research contests that the scale dates back much further 

The monks used the original six Solfeggio notes in their Gregorian chants, which we now know to consist of the frequencies: 396, 417, 528, 639, 741, and 852 (Hertz).

Unfortunately, by the 16th century the scale was lost, though the exact cause is unknown.

Some say the Solfeggio was simply abandoned for a new music scale, others argue that it disappeared among the political and religious turmoil of Western Europe’s Middle Ages.

And there are even some who posit some more, well, conspiratorial theories, from Biblical secrets to plots by the Roman Catholic Church.

Whatever the cause, the six-tone Solfeggio scale, also known as “Just Intonation”, was replaced by the “Twelve-Tone Equal Temperament”, which is what we still use today 

The soothing Gregorian chants used the Solfeggio scale.

## Why the Solfeggio Scale Is Important

But why exactly is this important? Why should you care how musicians tune their work?

It’s important because many argue that we lost more than a simple musical scale when the Solfeggio scale was replaced.

Our modern twelve-tone scale is said to suppress our emotions, stifle our intuition, and limit our consciousness. Scientifically, it is even out of sync with the natural world – and can thus may influence the manifestation of physical symptoms like fatigue, pain, stress and even disease.

On the other hand, the Solfeggio scale is mathematically consistent with the patterns of our universe and, as we’ll explain below, has been shown to have significant healing abilities.

From repairing emotional trauma and opening up spiritual consciousness, to deepening our relationships and even altering DNA, this ancient scale has far-reaching potential.

The good news is that the Solfeggio scale is no longer lost in history.

In the 1970s, a man named Dr. Joseph Puleo was inspired to use Pythagorean math to examine the Book of Numbers in the Old Testament Bible. In Chapter 7, verses 12 through 83, he uncovered a pattern.

And this pattern just so happened to coincide with the original six Solfeggio notes. Puleo published his work in the book, Healing Codes for the Biological Apocalypse, in partnership with Dr. Leonard Horowitz.

## The Original Solfeggio Tones

Each tone on the scale corresponds to a frequency. Those frequencies are described as followed:

### 1. 396 Hz (UT): Turning Grief into Joy, Liberating Guilt & Fear

The first or lowest frequency, 396 Hz, is associated with the tone ‘Ut’.

This frequency is important because of its ability to ease and remove the feelings of guilt and fear we’ve accumulated throughout our life.

These negative emotions hold us back from our goals. Clearing them from our subconscious mind enables us to make new progress in both the physical world and in our spiritual consciousness.

The 396 Hz frequency can influence the mind so that we spend less time racked with grief and worry and more time experiencing the joys and endless possibilities of life.

### 2. 417 Hz (RE): Undoing Situations & Facilitating Change

The next frequency on the scale, 417 Hz, is associated with the tone ‘Re’.

It is the frequency of change and renewal. Just as guilt and fear can be an obstacle along the path to growth, so too can the traumatic experiences we’ve had in life that remain impressed upon our consciousness.

Like waves washing over the seashore, 417 Hz clears the debris of negative memories and influences from our mind. It helps us change our perspective and face the present and future with fresh eyes and a fresh spirit.

### 3. 528 Hz (MI): Transformation, Miracles & DNA Repair

As we continue to work our way down the scale, we come to 528 Hz, which is also known as ‘Mi’.

Mi is comes from the Latin word Mira gestorum, or “miracle”. This is fitting for a note that brings with it miraculous transformation, not only in our consciousness but our DNA.

528 Hz is used in DNA repair, which brings with it increased energy, clarity and peace of mind and spirit, along with enhanced creativity. 528 Hz’s effects have also earned it the name the “Love frequency”.


### 4. 639 Hz (FA): Re-Connecting & Balancing Relationships

The fourth frequency on the scale is 639 Hz, or ‘Fa’.

It’s a tone of connection and relationships, creating peace and harmony in our interactions and communications with the people around us.

Whether friends, family, or strangers, it can smooth over any rockiness or resentment between us and our loved ones.

Fa is a social frequency, one of understanding, sympathy, tolerance, and mutual respect.

### 5. 741 Hz (SOL): Solving Problems, Expressions & Solutions

At the fifth frequency, we arrive at 741 Hz, otherwise known as ‘Sol’.

This is a tone of problem solving, more specifically problems relating to our ability to express ourselves freely and openly.

741 Hz frees us of emotional restrictions, but it also said to remove toxins and electromagnetic radiation from our cells.

741 Hz promotes a healthier and more stable life, both emotionally and physically.

### 6. 852 Hz (LA): Awakening Intuition, Returning to Spiritual Order

As we’ve climbed the scale from the lowest to the highest frequencies, we find ourselves dealing with higher planes of consciousness.

852 Hz or ‘La’, the last of the original Solfeggio frequencies, enables us to connect with a higher power and the ever-present spirit of the universe. It also gives us a glimpse of the spiritual order of the world, while also bringing us more in tune with our own higher self.

## Additional Modern Solfeggio Tones

While the ancient Solfeggio scale tones detailed above are the most notable and enduring, having been used for hundreds if not thousands of years, Dr. Leonard Horowitz applied the same patterns in his research to uncover three more frequencies.

### 7. 174 Hz: Security & Comfort

The lowest tone, 174 Hz, also affects us on the lowest plane, namely that of our physical body and energy.

It’s noted as a natural anesthetic, relieving pain both physically and energetically, while giving our internal organs a greater sense of security and comfort.

### 8. 285 Hz: Cellular Repair & Immunity

The next frequency, 285 Hz, goes even further in its treatment of the body. 285 Hz is associated with cellular repair, helping the body's tissue and organs to regenerate. Cell repair is also useful to the skin, assisting in the healing of burns, lacerations, and other damage.

This cellular repair is innately linked to the immune system, where the health of B and T cells is vitally important for fighting off viruses and disease.

The 285 Hz tone improves our health and overall well-being through rejuvenation of the body. The knock-on effect is better immunity, higher energy levels and all-round better well-being.

### 9. 963 Hz: Higher Consciousness

The last of the Solfeggio frequencies is 963 Hz, which takes us to the highest plane of consciousness.

This frequency connects us with the perfection of the universe, allowing us to tap into the Oneness that permeates everything that is and will be.

This frequency relates to the Crown Chakra, which is also linked to the Pineal Gland (central nervous system). Through this it is said we can access high-level intuition, telepathy, psychic vision and an intimate connection with “God”.

In music, solfège, or solfeggio, is an education method used to teach pitch and sight singing of Western music. The name is taken from two of the syllables used: sol and fa.

## How the Solfeggio Scale Can Help You

Our universe, from the sun to the stars to the device that you’re reading this page on, is made up of energy and vibrations. A musical frequency is simply another form of vibration.

We know that music affects the mind and body. Indeed, that is why music has always been a fundamental part of human existence. From early tribal drumming to modern complex orchestral compositions, music reflects and resonates with life, and promotes wellbeing.

We also know certain frequencies within music have specific effects on the mind, and subsequently the body. This is why there are so many music therapy and healing programs available in modern society.

It is no coincidence that the Benedictine monks of the 11th century tuned their chants to the Solfeggio scale. These were their prayers to a higher power, and they choose tones that resonated with their spiritual energy.

The Solfeggio scale has the ability to influence and transform wellbeing. It can help reduce emotional and physical ills, and create a deeper spiritual connection with the universe. All you have to do is simply listen.
