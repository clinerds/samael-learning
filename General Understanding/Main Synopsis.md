#### The Baader-Meinhof phenomenon

The Baader-Meinhof phenomenon, also known as frequency bias or the perception of frequency, is when you become aware of something and start noticing it everywhere, even though its occurrence hasn't actually increased. 

It's a common cognitive bias where your brain reinforces newly acquired information. This phenomenon can be harmless, but it can also lead to problems in scientific research, eyewitness accounts, medical diagnoses, and marketing strategies. 

The name "Baader-Meinhof" comes from a terrorist group in West Germany, and it became associated with this phenomenon due to a discussion board in the mid-1990s. Now that you know about it, you might encounter the Baader-Meinhof phenomenon more frequently.
