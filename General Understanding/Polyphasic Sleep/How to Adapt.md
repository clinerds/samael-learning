# Introduction

Adapting to a polyphasic sleep schedule is **extremely demanding** and can be extremely taxing both for the body and the mind. Specifically, many people described it as “**the worst thing they have ever done**“. Without knowing what to expect, you are setting yourself up for failure. Luckily, the community has throughout the years been able to investigate and develop multiple practices with the intention of helping YOU adapt successfully.

In this post, you will learn about everything there is to know about polyphasic sleep adaptations. In addition, we strongly encourage you to read through as much of the content here as possible before you start your journey. That **WILL** significantly help your adaptation!

Is Everyman 1 adaptation hard for me?

In this section, you will learn **everything you need to know** about an adaptation process to a polyphasic schedule. It does not matter if your schedule is non-reducing or otherwise. 

In addition, you will also be prepared to cope with different adaptation signs and symptoms. This is ultimately necessary to keep yourself on guard until you have adapted to your schedule. **There is nothing more important than a proper preparation** before you invest your time into an adaptation. Thus, there is NEVER too much preparation time!

Note that there are **new methods** that have been developed in order to help you adapt to different polyphasic schedules over the years. You may have never heard of these methods and tricks before, so pay close attention! You never know how helpful they can be.

Can I sleep earlier to fall asleep faster?

If you have finished reading through Adaptation 101, great! However, there are more intricate details awaiting you on the way! As a matter of fact, these are just as important as the generic adaptation introduction. 

Being **strict with your sleep times** is the tip you have heard many and many times. In fact, so many times that it may have become obvious for EVERY adaptation. However, is that true? Is it the only way to adapt to your schedule of choice?

Furthermore, when adapting, you may or may not face crippling sleep deprivation symptoms. Things may suck, and everything can look tough. Yet, as always, we provide you with certain countermeasures to boost your morale and self-belief. Persistence and patience are keys!

So far, you have understood the necessary tricks to hold on to your adaptation and keep things going. You seem to be doing well and things appear to really improve. But, you may be hitting a roadblock as those oversleeps start creeping into your schedule.

Not to mention, being stuck in that disgraceful stage 3-4 loop is nothing to laugh at, either. When more oversleeping occurs, it may spell doom to your adaptation…

**What can be your weapons to fight off these pesky setbacks reliably?**

Check out software programs that can **aid you in combating oversleeping**. All at your disposal.

The core ends at 3:30 AM, not PM!

**Friendly reminders**:

- Make sure your alarms actually function well. 
- Check your alarms at least twice **before** you sleep.
- Do not confuse or mistake **AM for PM** and vice versa!
