##  Copernican Revolution

The Copernican Revolution was a major shift in the understanding of the universe, specifically regarding the Earth's place in it. Prior to this revolution, the commonly held belief was that the Earth was at the center of the universe, with everything else revolving around it. This geocentric model was challenged by the heliocentric model proposed by the astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus in the 16th century. According to the heliocentric model, the Sun, not the Earth, was at the center of the universe, and the Earth and other planets revolved around it. This new model was revolutionary and fundamentally changed our understanding of the universe.

## Occam's Razor

Occam's Razor is a principle that suggests when faced with competing hypotheses that explain the same observations, the simpler one is generally the correct one. It was formulated by the 14th-century philosopher William of Ockham. The idea behind Occam's Razor is that nature is generally simple, and when presented with two or more complex theories, it is more likely that one of them is a more accurate representation of reality. This principle has been used to support and justify the Copernican Revolution, as the heliocentric model is simpler and more elegant than the geocentric model.
