#BugBounty #BugBountyResources

## I'm also starting in bug hunting, so far below are the resources I've found, I hope this might be useful to everyone:)

[https://github.com/bugcrowd/bugcrowd_university](https://github.com/bugcrowd/bugcrowd_university)  
  
The aim of this path is to teach you how to attack web applications. To successfully attack and exploit web applications, you need to understand how they work. The first section (Web Fundamentals) will give you all the pre-requisite knowledge on this.

In this methodology we are going to suppose that you are going to a attack a domain (or subdomain) and only that. So, you should apply this methodology to each discovered domain, subdomain or IP with undetermined web server inside the scope.

The OWASP Top Ten is a standard awareness document for developers and web application security. It represents a broad consensus about the most critical security risks to web applications.  
  
This cheat sheet will help users of the OWASP Top Ten identify which cheat sheets map to each security category. This mapping is based the OWASP Top Ten 2021 version.

SecLists is the security tester's companion. It's a collection of multiple types of lists used during security assessments, collected in one place. List types include usernames, passwords, URLs, sensitive data patterns, fuzzing payloads, web shells, and many more. The goal is to enable a security tester to pull this repository onto a new testing box and have access to every type of list that may be needed.

## Script to Message Fellow Bug Hunters For Guidance

Hi Martin,  

I hope you're doing well.  

I'm just starting out in bug hunting. I've been playing CTFs for a while, but I'm new to bug bounties. I've seen your work and really admire your skills.  

Could you share your approach to finding bugs? Any tips on tools, techniques, or resources would be super helpful. If you have a roadmap or any learning materials that you recommend, I'd love to hear about them.  

Thanks a lot for your time!
