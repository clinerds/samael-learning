- *Subdomains Enumeration with Subfinder by ProjectDiscovery.io*
- *Validate subdomains, titles, and status using HTTPX Toolkit*
- *Run Burp audit and crawling scan side by side*
- *Look for anything suspicious and browse it. If it's a website, search for JS parameters using ParamSpider and API secret keys using the tool in the notes. If not, do further enumeration and look for DNS records, mail records, etc.*
- *Also, try directory brute-forcing and use a new tool called FeroxBuster, which is faster.*
