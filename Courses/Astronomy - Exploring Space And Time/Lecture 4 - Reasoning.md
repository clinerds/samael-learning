>"If you don't have data or observation to support your theory/what you think, then it's an assumption not a deduction. ~ Samael"

**Notes:**

**Reasoning in Science:**

1. **Importance of Reasoning:**
   - Reasoning is a crucial part of the scientific method.
   - It involves using observations of the natural world and combining them to form structures or theories that explain a large range of phenomena.
   - Humans have remarkable powers of reasoning.
   - Although other sentient animals may have fairly high degrees of intelligence, humans have taken reasoning to an entirely new level.

2. **History of Reasoning:**
   - The last detectable anatomical changes in humans or in their brain chemistry date back about 40,000 years.
   - Humans had the power of reasoning even before the existence of science or civilization.
   - Formal ideas of reasoning started with the Greek philosophers, particularly Aristotle, who developed the rules of deductive logic.

3. **Deductive Logic:**
   - Deductive logic involves drawing conclusions and inferences by combining statements of the natural world.
   - The rules of deductive logic were developed by Aristotle and further codified by Bertrand Russell in the 20th century.
   - Deductive reasoning produces reliable conclusions if the premises are valid.
   - Examples:
     - "Two plus two equals four" is an example of deductive logic. It is always true, regardless of opinion or point of view.
     - In astronomy, if one observation demonstrates that the Earth is larger than the moon, and a second observation demonstrates that the sun is larger than the Earth, we can deductively combine these two statements to conclude that the sun is larger than the moon.

4. **Limitation of Deductive Logic:**
   - Deductive reasoning alone cannot guide and drive science.
   - While reliable, deductive reasoning doesn’t provide more information than was already present in the premises.

5. **Inductive Logic:**
   - Induction involves generalizing to a broad theory from a specific or limited set of observations.
   - It's a common practice in science as theories cannot be tested in all possible situations.
   - Examples:
     - Newton's theory of gravity explained the orbits of objects in the solar system, but he was confident enough to project that it would apply to as yet unobserved situations, such as Halley's Comet.
     - Darwinian theory of natural selection and evolution, proposed by Charles Darwin, was based on a limited set of observations but imputed to apply to all species and all forms of evolution over time in the history of the Earth.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - Science is based on reasoning, a particularly human attribute that has been present in our brains for tens of thousands of years.
   - Formal reasoning comes in two forms: deduction and induction.
   - Both forms of reasoning are used in all scientific fields to gain new knowledge.

  - **Importance of Reasoning:**
    - Reasoning is a crucial part of the scientific method. It allows us to use observations to form structures or theories that explain natural phenomena.
    - Although other animals may have some level of intelligence, humans have taken reasoning to a new level, allowing us to develop advanced scientific theories.

  - **History of Reasoning:**
    - Humans have had the power of reasoning for tens of thousands of years, even before the existence of science or civilization.
