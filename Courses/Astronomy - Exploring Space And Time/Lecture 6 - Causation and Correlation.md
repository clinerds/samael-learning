**Causation vs Correlation:**

- **Introduction:**
  - Formal aspects of correlation
  - Measurement of observations
  - Looking for relationships between variables

- **Causation vs Correlation:**
  - **Definition:**
    - **Correlation:** Relationship between two or more variables.
    - **Causation:** The relationship between cause and effect; one event causing another to happen.
  - **Misinterpretation:**
    - Correlation does not imply causation.
    - Famous examples in history due to the confusion between causation and correlation.

- **Examples:**
  1. **Temperature and Pirates:**
     - **Observation:**
       - Higher temperature correlates with more pirates.
     - **Question:**
       - Does heat make pirates, or are there more pirate activities in hot regions?
     - **Conclusion:**
       - Correlation does not reveal the underlying cause.

  2. **Bertrand Russell's Chicken:**
     - **Scenario:**
       - A chicken correlated the rising sun with being fed.
     - **Outcome:**
       - The farmer ended up slaughtering the chicken.
     - **Lesson:**
       - The chicken confused correlation with causation.

  3. **Margaret Mead's Observation:**
     - **Observation:**
       - South Pacific Islanders put head lice into children's hair.
     - **Explanation:**
       - Islanders believed head lice prevented fever.
     - **Conclusion:**
       - Confusion of correlation and causation.

- **Probability and Chance in Science:**
  - **Macroscopic Examples:**
    - Spinning a coin or rolling a dice.
    - Probability of a coin toss always 50%.
  - **Misinterpretation:**
    - Fallacy: A six is more probable after a series of non-six rolls.
    - Reality: The probability remains the same: one in six.
  - **Behavior of Probabilistic Situations:**
    - Predictable with a large number of events.
    - Unpredictable with one event.
  - **Scientific Approach:**
    - Scientists gather lots of information to establish probability with smaller bounds.

- **Microscopic Uncertainty:**
  - **Example: Radioactive Decay**
    - Half-life: The time within which half of the atoms in a sample will decay.
    - **Uncertainty:**
      - Well-determined time for half-life.
      - Uncertain when each individual atom will decay.
  - **Another Example: Popcorn**
    - Prediction of when half the kernels will pop is reliable.
    - Indeterminable when a particular kernel will pop.

- **Scientific Principle:**
  - Scientists gather more and more data to overcome uncertainties and refine inferences.

**Explanation:**

Causation vs Correlation:

- **Introduction:**
  - Correlation: Relationship between different variables or parameters.
  - Causation: The relationship where one event causes another to happen.
  - Scientists measure observations to find relationships between different variables.

- **Causation vs Correlation:**
  - **Definition:**
    - Correlation: It's when two or more things are associated with each other.
    - Causation: It's when one thing causes another to happen.
  - **Misinterpretation:**
    - Correlation doesn't always imply causation, and mistaking one for the other can lead to significant errors in science.

- **Examples:**
  1. **Temperature and Pirates:**
     - **Observation:**
       - There's a correlation between high temperatures and the number of pirates.
     - **Question:**
       - Does heat make pirates, or are there more pirate activities in hot regions?
     - **Conclusion:**
       - The correlation does not explain the actual cause.

  2. **Bertrand Russell's Chicken:**
     - **Scenario:**
       - A chicken associated the rising sun with being fed.
     - **Outcome:**
       - The farmer ended up slaughtering the chicken.
     - **Lesson:**
       - The chicken confused correlation with causation.
