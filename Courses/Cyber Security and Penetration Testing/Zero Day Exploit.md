#CyberSecurity #ZeroDay 
## Chapter 1: Introduction

- Hacking involves breaking through cybersecurity walls using special techniques.
    
    - Movies and TV shows depict hacking as bashing the keyboard to gain access.
        
    - In reality, breaking good cybersecurity requires finding vulnerabilities or "bugs."
        
- Walls on the internet protect data of companies, nations, and individuals.
    
    - People pay for products to avoid being hacked.
        
- Hacking methods include scaling or breaking through smaller walls, social engineering, and exploiting flaws in code.
    
    - Flawed bricks in the code represent vulnerabilities that can be exploited.
        
    - Companies pay for revealing bugs and issue patches to fix vulnerabilities.
        
- A "0 day" is a secret vulnerability that can breach security without detection.
    
    - Finding a useful 0 day is challenging and highly sought after in the hacking community.
        
    - Bugtraq is a platform where hackers used to share 0 days before the marketplace evolved.
        

## Chapter 2: Develop An Exploit

- Early hackers would notify companies about 0 days in their software but often faced legal threats.
    
- Bugtraq evolved into a platform where hackers could share 0 days for recognition.
    
- Over time, a marketplace for 0 days emerged where buyers offer compensation for vulnerabilities.
    
- Middlemen, known as 0 day brokers, facilitate transactions between buyers and sellers.
    
    - They confirm the effectiveness of vulnerabilities and hold funds in escrow.
        
- Buyers purchase information from brokers or hackers, develop exploits, and use them to breach security systems.
    
- An example of an exploit is designed to infect iPhones through an invisible iMessage without the user's knowledge.
    

## Chapter 3: Day To Flaw

### Operation Triangulation

- A chain of 4 zero-day vulnerabilities exploited to gain unrestricted access to iPhones.
    
- Named Operation Triangulation despite having 4 prongs.
    
- Xerodium, a broker company, reveals prices for zero-day exploits.
    
    - Prices range from $100,000 to $1,000,000 depending on the level of access.
        
- Governments are the primary buyers of such exploits due to their financial resources and intelligence value.
    
- Focus on high-value systems like iPhone and Android software, critical infrastructure, and cryptocurrency systems.
    

### Cost and Impact of Zero-Day Exploits

- Actual costs of exploits vary, with some broker companies not disclosing prices.
    
- Operation 0 offered $20,000,000 for an exploit in 2023, indicating the high value of certain exploits.
    
- Exploits can target devices beyond phones, such as industrial controllers or entire networks.
    
- NotPetya caused $1,000,000,000 in damages by exploiting a single zero-day.
    
- Governments can use zero-days for cyber warfare against other nations and their citizens.
    

### Zero-Day Market

- Zero-day exploits are traded on a market with various players.
    
- Some companies offer bug bounty programs to encourage legal vulnerability reporting.
    
- Lack of regulation and enforcement in the zero-day market raises concerns about its legality and seriousness compared to arms trading.
    

## Chapter 4: White Market Works

- **White Market**:
    
    - Researchers in the white market get paid or gain exposure.
        
    - Companies in this market are visible and may advertise their findings.
        
    - Researchers may be found on platforms like LinkedIn, hiring for vulnerability research.
        
- **Gray Market**:
    
    - Governments invest in research and hide findings from the public.
        
    - Hackers are paid for their silence, and 0 days are used for spying and cyber warfare.
        
    - The market is morally dubious, unregulated, and involves governments purchasing exploits.
        
- **Black Market**:
    
    - Involves illegal activities with much higher values than the white market.
        
    - International crime networks, local governments, and non-state actors operate illicitly.
        
    - Example of a ransomware attack on MoveIt software by the CLOP gang highlighted the impact of the black market.
        
- **Evolution of 0 Day Exploits**:
    
    - Transition from nation states and contractors to cybercriminals using 0 day exploits.
        
    - Cybercriminals utilize 0 days in ransomware attacks, hacks of cryptocurrency exchanges, and wallets.
        

## Operation Triangulation and Operation 0

- **Operation Triangulation**:
    
    - Exploit using 40 days to access iPhones, detected by Kaspersky researchers.
        
    - Signs of a state-sponsored hacker army targeting Russian government officials.
        
    - Russian Federal Security Service identified American intelligence agencies as the attackers.
        
- **Operation 0**:
    
    - Offered $20,000,000 for a similar attack chain, selling exploits only to Russian intelligence agencies.
        
    - Founded by a former Kaspersky employee, raising concerns about the attack on Kaspersky.
        
    - Selling a 0 day to Zorodium for the NSA is considered gray market, while selling to Operation 0 is black market.
        
- **Global Landscape**:
    
    - Hackers worldwide navigate different markets based on their country's rules and alignment.
        
    - Each country aims to gain an edge in cyberspace, setting its own regulations for cyber activities.
        

## Chapter 5: Know The Purchase

- **Different markets for vulnerabilities**
    
    - White, gray, and black markets exist for governments to acquire vulnerabilities.
        
    - Governments prefer white and gray markets unless they can't access them.
        
    - Cerodium and Operation 0 are transparent in selling to governments.
        
    - Brokers often operate in secrecy, selling to undisclosed parties.
        
- **Lack of regulation and prosecution**
    
    - Difficulty in regulating the 0 day market due to secrecy and anonymity.
        
    - Prosecuting anonymous entities facilitating purchases is complex.
        
    - Brokers often granted immunity to gather information rather than facing prosecution.
        
- **Complexity and opacity of the zero-day market**
    
    - Operates without regulation or prosecution, blurring legality and morality.
        
    - Sprawling, complex, and mostly invisible market.
        
    - Underground sale of weapons raises concerns for regulation or banning.
        
- **Perspective from intelligence agencies**
    
    - Former intelligence professionals see the value of retaining 0 days for offensive purposes.
        
    - US government's vulnerability equities process evaluates the use of 0 days for intelligence versus infrastructure security.
        
    - Not all 0 days are equal, and their use can be complex and nuanced.
        
- **Case study: LockBit takedown**
    
    - LockBit, a criminal organization, was taken down by a global law enforcement task force.
        
    - The operation likely involved the use of a 0 day exploit.
        
    - Governments and law enforcement agencies sometimes use exploits for legitimate purposes, despite ethical concerns.
