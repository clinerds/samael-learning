The video argues that rather than detoxing from dopamine, we should instead re-sensitize ourselves to it . Dopamine is a neurochemical that plays a key role in motivation and reward. When we are overstimulated by things like social media, we become less sensitive to dopamine. This means that we need more and more stimulation to feel good.

The video suggests a few ways to re-sensitize ourselves to dopamine:

- Take boring breaks. When you take a break from work, avoid doing stimulating activities like checking social media or reading the news. Instead, do something boring like staring at a wall or taking a nap . This will help to reset your dopamine receptors and make work more rewarding.
- Inhabit the in-between. When you are in between tasks, such as waiting in line or sitting at lunch alone, avoid reaching for your phone. Instead, take a few minutes to simply be present in the moment. This will help you to become more sensitive to dopamine over time.
- Do one thing at a time. Multitasking can actually make it harder to focus and be productive. When you are working on a task, focus on that task alone. This will help you to train your brain to shift more quickly between the default mode network and the task positive network. The default mode network is active when you are not engaged in a task, while the task positive network is active when you are focused. By training your brain to shift more quickly between these networks, you can improve your focus and reward sensitivity.

By following these tips, you can re-sensitize yourself to dopamine and make hard work more rewarding . This will help you to be more productive and achieve your goals .
