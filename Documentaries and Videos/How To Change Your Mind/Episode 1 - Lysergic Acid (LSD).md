**Netflix Documentary:** How to Change Your Mind
**Episode 1:** Lysergic Acid (LSD)


A man who tries various types of psychedelic substances called a Psychonaut

The main narrative follows Michael, a 65-year-old writer and professor, who embarks on a journey of exploring psychedelics, starting with LSD. He is guided by Erika, a self-described ceremonial leader and wisdom keeper, who introduces him to the indigenous use of tobacco as a sacred medicine. Michael's initial experience with tobacco is intense and cathartic, revealing the potential of substances traditionally viewed as harmful to heal in different contexts.

The episode delves into the broader history and potential of psychedelics for treating mental health issues such as PTSD, OCD, alcoholism, and depression. Michael explores the historical use of psychedelics, highlighting groundbreaking studies in Switzerland where healthy volunteers took high doses of LSD under medical supervision to understand its effects on the mind and body. One participant recounts a profound experience of reliving a traumatic birth memory, which led to a deeper understanding and emotional processing.

Albert Hofmann's discovery of LSD in 1943 is recounted, noting how his accidental ingestion led to profound visual and emotional experiences. Sandoz, the pharmaceutical company he worked for, distributed LSD to researchers worldwide, leading to a fertile period of study in the 1950s and early 1960s. The drug was initially seen as a potential miracle treatment for mental health issues, but its association with countercultural movements and figures like Timothy Leary shifted public perception.

Leary's advocacy for LSD as a tool for personal and societal transformation led to widespread use and eventual backlash. The episode discusses the CIA's involvement in psychedelic research, which inadvertently turned people like Ken Kesey into counterculture icons. The cultural upheaval of the 1960s, characterized by anti-war protests and alternative lifestyles, was significantly influenced by psychedelics, contributing to a government crackdown and the classification of LSD as a Schedule I drug.

Despite the shutdown of official research, psychedelic use persisted in various subcultures, notably influencing the tech industry in Silicon Valley. Innovators like Stewart Brand and Kary Mullis attributed part of their creative breakthroughs to psychedelic experiences. The episode highlights the resurgence of interest in psychedelic research in the early 2000s, particularly in Switzerland, where studies began anew on the therapeutic potential of LSD for conditions like anxiety in cancer patients.

Michael reflects on modern trends such as microdosing, where individuals take small, non-hallucinogenic doses of psychedelics to improve mood and creativity. He speaks with Ayelet Waldman, who used microdosing to alleviate severe depression and suicidal thoughts, underscoring the potential benefits and ongoing stigma surrounding these substances.

Finally, Michael shares his own LSD experience, which was emotionally profound and reinforced the importance of love and connection. The episode concludes with a teaser for the next phase of his journey, exploring psilocybin from magic mushrooms, as he continues to investigate the mysteries of consciousness and the therapeutic potential of psychedelics.
