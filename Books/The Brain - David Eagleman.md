#Book #BookSummary #TheBrainByDavidEagleman 
The brain is an uncanny thing. It’s both profoundly natural and completely unusual.  

We typically consider it a cockpit constrained by our very own identity. In any case, as an individual who’s examined the brain – from old fashioned Freudians to the most exceptional neuroscientists – will let you know, it’s regularly the concealed hand of the psyche that is running the show.  

That is not really a terrible thing. On the off chance that we needed to deliberately process each longing, activity, and signal, life would end up incomprehensible. Just drinking some espresso would be totally depleting.  

Be that as it may, it raises a lot of fascinating inquiries. What truly makes us our identity? How would we settle on choices and achieve decisions about the idea of the real world? For what reason do individuals change so drastically after some time?  

That is the place these outline parts come in. They do not just answer these inquiries; they give a wide-running voyage through the cerebrum that is as animating as it is provocative.  

## The consistently changing associations in your mind shape your identity.  

Life might be capricious. In any case, there is one consistent – individuals change. In some cases, we improve and smooth with age, similar to a decent wine. Some of the time, similar to a once-tolerable vintage that swings to vinegar, we sharp and become unpalatable.  

You may have encountered the identity adjusting impacts of time. Ever gotten together with a companion from your school days and wound up pondering the end result for the individual you once knew? How might somebody change to such an extent? What’s the science behind it?  

Indeed, it’s about how the cerebrum changes after some time. From birth ahead, our minds are continually making new associations and adjusting to new circumstances. This shapes our identities.  

Take a two-year-old kid. Her mind has an indistinguishable number of cerebrum cells however twice from numerous neurotransmitters – associations which transmit data – like a grown-up. This is on the grounds that, as people age, they lose the synaptic associations that haven’t been strengthened by steady redundancy.  

Consider language. It’s hard to mirror or recognize the hints of unknown dialects since you weren’t presented to them as a youngster.  

This applies to identify all the more for the most part. The synaptic associations that make you are the aftereffect of all that you’ve at any point been presented to. At the end of the day, each individual you meet, the film you watch or book you read shapes your identity!  

Call it versatility. That is an extravagant term for the cerebrum’s capacity to “learn” by redundancy – a capacity that is absolutely not limited to youngsters. Grown-up minds are likewise fit for change.  

This appeared in an examination did by researchers at University College London. They filtered the cerebrums of a portion of the city’s cabbies and found that they had bigger hippocampi – the hippocampus is the piece of the mind in charge of spatial memory – than the control gathering.  

---

The clarification? Cabbies have what’s classified “the Knowledge” – an exact memory of London’s 25,000 boulevards, 20,000 tourist spots and 320 distinct courses, which every one of them procured amid four years of preparing.  

Investing so much energy practicing their recollections implied that the taxi drivers fortified certain associations in their minds. It’s somewhat similar to an exercise; the focused on territory developed because of consistent use.  

That kind of progress can likewise dramatically affect identity.  

Possibly you’ve known about Charles Whitman, the man who killed his better half and mother and after that shot and executed another 13 individuals with a rifle from on a pinnacle at the University of Texas, in 1966. What you can be sure of is that a posthumous done after he’d been shot to death discovered a tumor in his cerebrum. It was situated in the part that is in charge of dread and hostility.  

---

## Your feeling of reality mirrors your mind’s understanding of tangible information, and it isn’t objective.  

---

We want to think that we see the world as it truly may be. Be that as it may, recollect the last time you saw an optical hallucination that made your mind abruptly register another picture. What resembled an image of a duck, to take a renowned precedent, can all of a sudden appear to portray a rabbit.  

This exhibits how the cerebrum can, in a manner of speaking, alter its perspective on what’s genuine.  

One reason that happens is that it gets new data. Your feeling of the world isn’t only a result of your mind – it’s additionally formed by the tangible organs in charge of smell, taste, and sight.  

Take the decoration winning Paralympic skier Mike May.  

He lost his sight at three years old. In his forties, he had a medical procedure to reestablish his vision. In any case, recovering his visual perception wasn’t an inadequate help. He felt over-burden and frightened. He couldn’t perceive his kids. Skiing was additionally all of a sudden much trickier.  

That is on the grounds that his cerebrum hadn’t figured out how to see. It was so used to depending on different faculties that it couldn’t process all the new data. The loss of movement in his visual cortex as a tyke drove his cerebrum to overcompensate in different territories.  

So our eyes don’t care for camcorders handing-off data to the mind. Undoubtedly, locate is really a joint effort between these two organs. That implies that your feeling of the truth is a result of the manner in which your mind translates data.  

Consider synesthesia, a condition where tangible observations are stirred up with each other. Individuals who have it report encounters, for example, tasting words composed on a page and hearing music as shading.  

---

In the last case, the piece of the cerebrum that typically responds when an individual respects, state, the shades of dusk is similarly prone to be activated by hearing a bit of music.  

Does that mean individuals with synesthesia are basically fantasizing? Not in any manner! Tangible organs give the cerebrum data that is translated as the real world. Be that as it may, this data is never in excess of an impression of the world “out there.”  

---

## Most choices are made intuitively.  

---

What amount of control do you have over your activities? Likewise, with numerous philosophical inquiries, the appropriate response relies upon how you characterize your terms. In case no doubt about it to allude to the cognizant self, in all actuality you have little access to the piece of your mind that controls the guiding wheel.  

Be that as it may, that is not as disrupting as it may sound. Truth be told, it’s essential to working ordinarily. Envision having a discussion or drinking some espresso on the off chance that you needed to concentrate on consistent development those exercises include.  

The main reason these activities aren’t very troublesome is that drilled aptitudes are performed subliminally. But essentially, you’re better at doing things when you don’t ponder them.  

Take Austin Naber, a ten-year-old hero sport stacker. That is a game wherein players go up against the check to stack containers in various shapes. He and the creator were associated with EEG machines that measure the cerebrum’s movement and requested to play out a glass stacking schedule.  

This was a requesting task for the creator since it was new. His mind used tremendous measures of vitality endeavoring to finish the undertaking.  

Austin’s cerebrum, then again, was very still. He’d performed comparative schedules so frequently that the structure of his mind had physically changed. Stacking containers never again expected him to connect with his cognizant cerebrum!  

When you achieve a specific dimension of capability, the cognizant exertion really prompts botches. Baseball players, for instance, hit the ball without intentionally settling on a choice to do as such. That is similarly too on the grounds that the human mind isn’t quick enough to precisely check the speed of the approaching ball and choose when to swing the bat.  

However, your subliminal makes major decisions notwithstanding when you’re not playing focused games. It’s similarly prone to be in charge when you’re settling on regular choices.  

Developmental clinician Geoffrey Miller exhibited this in an examination that looked at how a lot of cash female artists at strip clubs earned at different phases of their menstrual cycle.  

He found that when artists were ovulating, and in this manner ripe, men gave them twice the same number of tips as they passed out to their non-ovulating partners. His clarification? Men intuitively got on unobtrusive changes in the ladies’ appearances that were brought about by higher estrogen levels.  

---

Different examinations report comparative discoveries. You’re considerably more prone to think about somebody’s conduct as improper if there’s a terrible stench noticeable all around. Furthermore, in case you’re grasping a warm beverage, you’re bound to depict your associations with others energetically.  

The specialized term for this sort of subliminal movement is preparing. It fundamentally implies that tangible information impacts our discernments notwithstanding when we’re not mindful of it.  

---

## Basic leadership is formed by our wants, dopamine and the mind’s inclination for transient addition.  

---

Life is brimming with choices, from commonplace inquiries regarding which shoes to wear to life-characterizing decisions about which vocation to seek after. So what does that inform us regarding the cerebrum? How about we investigate how individuals settle on decisions.  

Here are the means by which it works: tactile and passionate criticism trigger various pieces of the cerebrum until you settle on a choice.  

Indeed, even ordinary inquiries concerning what you ought to have for lunch can invigorate exceptional neural movement. Pondering minestrone versus broccoli soup sends a wide range of tactile and passionate relationship into overdrive.  

That can make an input circle. On the off chance that you make the most of your choice, your cerebrum discharges dopamine. That, thus, will turn out to be a piece of the contention next time you’re gone up against with a comparable decision.  

You can perceive how intently the mind and body cooperate by taking a gander at situations where the association between the two has been disjointed.  

Take Tammy Myers. In a motorbike mishap, she harmed the piece of her cerebrum that provides details regarding her passionate and physical state. That implies she can never again tell, for instance, regardless of whether she’s worn out, fulfilled, parched or disturbed. Correspondence has separated to such a degree, that she’s unequipped for weighing up various choices.  

Another factor forming basic leadership is the mind’s inclination for a momentary increase.  

The cerebrum doesn’t care for hanging tight for an envisioned future. Prompt prizes trump theoretical long haul adjustments. That is the reason individuals take out low-intrigue credits that they’re unfit to reimburse and why hitched individuals have illicit relationships they later lament.  

So how would you fight off enticement and play the long diversion? One path is to sign a “Ulysses Contract.”  

As indicated by Greek legend, Ulysses was the chief of a ship that cruised past an island possessed by Sirens – hazardous animals whose delightful tunes entranced mariners, baiting them into shrouded rocks, whereupon their vessels would wreck. Ulysses had his group attach him to the ship’s pole (different mariners stuffed their ears with cotton) to keep him from directing the ship toward the Sirens, and he lived to tell the story.  

What would you be able to gain from this model?  

All things considered, state you need to adhere to your new exercise plan. Why not tie yourself to a consent to meet your companion at the rec center? On the off chance that you need to avoid Facebook amid tests, have a companion change your secret phrase. Quitting any pretense of smoking? Hurl your cigarettes and lighters in the garbage.  

---

## Socialization is one of the mind’s fundamental capacities and it helps the opportunity of gathering survival.  

---

People are social creatures. That is reflected in the manner our minds work. We’re continually attempting to peruse other individuals and make sense of who has a place with our gathering and who doesn’t. How would we approach this? Through compassion – the capacity to identify with other individuals and their feelings.  

Figuring out how to be sympathetic is tied in with reflecting. When we collaborate with other individuals, we mirror their outward appearances to tell our minds what they’re considering and feeling. That is one reason hitched couples frequently end up appearing to be similar alike. Long periods of reflecting each other’s outward appearances really shape their appearance, notwithstanding bringing about comparable wrinkle designs!  

The creator needed to discover exactly how significant this sort of reflecting is and directed analysis. He chose a gathering made up of individuals who’d had the restorative injectable Botox and the individuals who hadn’t.  

In the wake of connecting the members to a gadget that estimates facial muscle development, he indicated them photos of a scope of various outward appearances.  

The outcome? The members who’d had Botox weren’t simply less facially portable themselves; they were additionally much more awful at translating the feelings of others! That is on the grounds that we read feelings by reflecting the feelings showed on others’ countenances.  

Sympathy additionally shapes how we identify with individuals who have a place with an outgroup – that is, individuals who aren’t “like us” and are along these lines less meriting our help.  

Take an examination did at the University of Leiden in the Netherlands wherein members appeared of vagrants. The members enrolled substantially less mind movement when demonstrated these pictures than they, for the most part, would when pondering or communicating with individuals who weren’t destitute. Put all the more unmistakably, they saw these vagrants and ladies as articles.  

News sources and promulgation regularly assume a conclusive job in dehumanizing individuals according to other people. In the mid-1990s, in Yugoslavia, Serbian media channels began running stories intended to impel scorn of the Muslim populace. Cases started to flow that Muslims were bolstering Serbian kids to the lions in zoos, the point is to make watchers see Muslims as a dehumanized outgroup undeserving of any sympathy.

## Innovation can bolster the working of the cerebrum, however, it can’t supplant it.  

---

We live during a time of uncommon neurological and innovative advances that put yesterday’s most out of control science fiction dreams to disgrace. Take the way that we currently realize that minds can adjust to non-organic sign. It’s a genuinely progressive revelation despite everything we don’t have the foggiest idea the amount it might transform us.  

Consider cochlear inserts – electronic gadgets utilized by individuals with hearing disabilities. This hand-off a computerized sign to the cerebrum. It’s somewhat similar to learning a totally new dialect; all alone, the sign is good for nothing, however, when it’s cross-referenced with different faculties, the mind starts to “hear” it.  

That, thusly, recommends that we may before long be equipped for transferring different sorts of data legitimately to the cerebrum. Envision getting the climate figure, traffic updates and message pop-ups inside your head!  

At that point, there’s space investigation. The human body is dreadfully delicate to make due in space for exceptionally long. Be that as it may, what might occur in the event that we could carefully transfer our minds to an increasingly solid machine? The intergalactic boondocks would all of a sudden be tossed wide open.  

Sometime in the not so distant future, we may most likely travel some light-years by closing the cerebrum down while the machine went through space and afterward “rebooting” it when the shuttle achieved its goal.  

Right now, PCs aren’t anyplace near being prepared to do such an accomplishment, however, there’s each motivation to feel that they may be sooner rather than later. All things considered, figuring power is presently an amazing one-thousand time more dominant than it was only 20 years prior.  

Connecting our cerebrums with registering advances would check a defining moment ever of. It would be the start of a totally new period – a time of transhumanism.  

Yet, anyway much advances improve and begin supporting or notwithstanding supplanting the human body, they’ll never have the option to supplant the human mind.  

---

As the rationalist John Searle contended during the 1980s, PCs can without much of a stretch outperform people with regards to finishing errands, however, they can’t create mindfulness.  

Consider it along these lines: When you ask Google an inquiry, it doesn’t get you – it utilizes a calculation that breaks down the words you use. Having a gigantic database encourages it to produce answers to your inquiries, yet that is a long ways from real mindfulness.

## The Brain: The Story of You by David Eagleman Book Review

---

All that you’ve encountered shape your identity. All the more explicitly, encounters trigger responses in your cerebrum and this leaves an enduring imprint on your identity. This, thusly, shapes your cerebrum’s impression of the world. In any case, nothing is fixed – you can rebuild your cerebrum.  

Mechanical advances in the course of the most recent couple of decades reveal to us that intellectual revamping will turn out to be progressively normal, establishing the framework for another “transhuman age.” But in spite of the fact that machines can upgrade our cerebrums, there’s one thing they can’t do – supplant them.

#### Born Unfinished:

In contrast, humans are able to thrive in many different environments, from the frozen tundra to the high mountains to bustling urban centers. This is possible because the human brain is born remarkably unfinished. Instead of arriving with everything wired up – let’s call it “**hardwired**” – a human brain allows itself to be shaped by the details of life experience.

#### Childhood pruning: exposing the statue in the marble:

At birth, a baby’s neurons are disparate and unconnected, and in the first two years of life they begin connecting up extremely rapidly as they take in sensory information.

As many as two million new connections, or synapses, are formed every second in an infant’s brain. By age two, a child has over one hundred trillion synapses, double the number an adult has.

It has now reached a peak and has far more connections than it will need. At this point, the blooming of new connections is supplanted by a strategy of neural “pruning”.

As you mature, 50% of your synapses will be pared back. Which synapses stay and which go? When a synapse successfully participates in a circuit, it is strengthened; in contrast, synapses weaken if they aren’t useful, and eventually they are eliminated.

**_'You become who you are not because of what grows in your brain, but because of what is removed. - David Eagleman'_**

#### Nature’s gamble

Nelson explains that he’d walk into a room and be surrounded by little kids he’d never seen before – and they’d want to jump into his arms and sit on his lap or hold his hand or walk off with him. Although this sort of indiscriminate behavior seems sweet at first glance, it’s a coping strategy of neglected children, and it goes hand-in-hand with long-term attachment issues.

**_"Without an environment with emotional care and cognitive stimulation, the human brain cannot develop normally. - David Eagleman"_**

##### The teen years:

Before sending them into this socially awkward situation, we rigged up each volunteer so we’d be able to measure their emotional response. We hooked them up with a device to measure the galvanic skin response (GSR), a useful proxy for anxiety: the more your sweat glands open, the higher your skin conductance will be. (This is, by the way, the same technology used in a lie detector, or polygraph test.)

the teens were much more anxious – some to the point of trembling – while they were being watched.

the brain called the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). This region becomes active when you think about your self – and especially the emotional significance of a situation to your self

the mPFC becomes more active in social situations, peaking at around fifteen years old. At this point, social situations carry a lot of emotional weight, resulting in a self-conscious stress response of high intensity.


the teen brain is set up to take risks. Whether it’s driving fast or sexting naked photos, risky behaviors are more tempting to the teen brain than to the adult brain.

pleasure seeking (one such area is called the nucleus accumbens). In teens, the activity here is as high as it is in adults.

teens are not only emotionally hypersensitive, but also less able to control their emotions than adults.

#### Plasticity in Adulthood:

By the time we’re twenty-five years of age, the brain transformations of childhood and adolescence are finally over

the drivers, the posterior part of the hippocampus had grown physically larger than those in the control group – presumably causing their increased spatial memory.

Albert Einstein’s brain did not reveal the secret of his genius. But it did show that the brain area devoted to his left fingers had expanded – forming a giant fold in his cortex called the Omega sign, shaped like the Greek symbol – all thanks to his less commonly known passion for playing the violin.

This fold becomes enlarged in experienced violin players, who intensively develop fine dexterity with the fingers of their left hand. Piano players, in contrast, develop an Omega sign in both hemispheres, as they use both hands in fine, detailed movements

everything you’ve experienced has altered the physical structure of your brain – from the expression of genes to the positions of molecules to the architecture of neurons. Your family of origin, your culture, your friends, your work, every movie you’ve watched, every conversation you’ve had – these have all left their footprints in your nervous system. These indelible, microscopic impressions accumulate to make you who you are, and to constrain who you can become.

#### Pathological Changes:

the amygdala, which is involved in fear and aggression.

your brain can alter the fabric of who you are. Consider the ingestion of drugs or alcohol. Particular kinds of epilepsy make people more religious. Parkinson’s disease often makes people lose their faith, while the medication for Parkinson’s can often turn people into compulsive gamblers.

everything contributes to a continual reshaping of the neural networks we summarize as us

#### Am I the sum of my memories?

Every four months your red blood cells are entirely replaced, for instance, and your skin cells are replaced every few weeks. Within about seven years every atom in your body will be replaced by other atoms.

Perhaps memory can serve as the thread that makes you who you are. It sits at the core of your identity, providing a single, continuous sense of self.

Everything you experience triggers particular patterns of activity in your brain.

Your neurons operate in a dynamic matrix of shifting relationships, and heavy demand is continually placed on them to wire with others. So your memory of the birthday dinner has become muddied, as those “birthday” neurons have been co-opted to participate in other memory networks. The enemy of memory isn’t time; it’s other memories.

a faded memory doesn’t seem faded to you. You feel, or at least assume, that the full picture is there.

So a single event may be perceived somewhat differently by you at different stages in your life.

#### The Fallablity of Memory

leading questions could contaminate memory

it possible to implant false new memories in the brain, but people embraced and embel- bished them, unknowingly weaving fantasy into the fabric of their identity.

Our past is not a faithful record. Instead it's a reconstruction, and sometimes it can border on mythology.

When we review our life memories, we should do so with the awareness that not all the details are accurate. Some came from stories that people told us about ourselves; others were filled in with what we thought must've happened.

#### The Aging Brain

psychological distress were related to more rapid cognitive decline. Positive traits like Conscientiousness, purpose in life, and keeping busy were protective

The more we keep our brains cognitively fit-typically by challenging them with difficult and novel tasks, including social interaction- the more the neural networks build new roadways to get from A to B.

even if many path- ways degenerate because of disease, the brain can retrieve other solutions.

#### Brains are Like Snowflakes:

what I think we can say: the meaning of something to you is all about your webs of associations, based on the whole history of your life experiences,

You don't perceive objects as they are You perceive them as you are.

As your trillions of new connections continually form and re-form, the distinctive pattern means that no one like you has ever existed, or will ever exist
