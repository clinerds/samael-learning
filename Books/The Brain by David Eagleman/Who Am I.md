#### Born Unfinished:

In contrast, humans are able to thrive in many different environments, from the frozen tundra to the high mountains to bustling urban centers. This is possible because the human brain is born remarkably unfinished. Instead of arriving with everything wired up – let’s call it “**hardwired**” – a human brain allows itself to be shaped by the details of life experience.

#### Childhood pruning: exposing the statue in the marble:

At birth, a baby’s neurons are disparate and unconnected, and in the first two years of life they begin connecting up extremely rapidly as they take in sensory information.

As many as two million new connections, or synapses, are formed every second in an infant’s brain. By age two, a child has over one hundred trillion synapses, double the number an adult has.

It has now reached a peak and has far more connections than it will need. At this point, the blooming of new connections is supplanted by a strategy of neural “pruning”.

As you mature, 50% of your synapses will be pared back. Which synapses stay and which go? When a synapse successfully participates in a circuit, it is strengthened; in contrast, synapses weaken if they aren’t useful, and eventually they are eliminated.

#### Nature’s gamble

Nelson explains that he’d walk into a room and be surrounded by little kids he’d never seen before – and they’d want to jump into his arms and sit on his lap or hold his hand or walk off with him. Although this sort of indiscriminate behavior seems sweet at first glance, it’s a coping strategy of neglected children, and it goes hand-in-hand with long-term attachment issues.

##### The teen years:

Before sending them into this socially awkward situation, we rigged up each volunteer so we’d be able to measure their emotional response. We hooked them up with a device to measure the galvanic skin response (GSR), a useful proxy for anxiety: the more your sweat glands open, the higher your skin conductance will be. (This is, by the way, the same technology used in a lie detector, or polygraph test.)

the teens were much more anxious – some to the point of trembling – while they were being watched.

the brain called the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). This region becomes active when you think about your self – and especially the emotional significance of a situation to your self

the mPFC becomes more active in social situations, peaking at around fifteen years old. At this point, social situations carry a lot of emotional weight, resulting in a self-conscious stress response of high intensity.


the teen brain is set up to take risks. Whether it’s driving fast or sexting naked photos, risky behaviors are more tempting to the teen brain than to the adult brain.

pleasure seeking (one such area is called the nucleus accumbens). In teens, the activity here is as high as it is in adults.

teens are not only emotionally hypersensitive, but also less able to control their emotions than adults.

#### Plasticity in Adulthood:

By the time we’re twenty-five years of age, the brain transformations of childhood and adolescence are finally over

the drivers, the posterior part of the hippocampus had grown physically larger than those in the control group – presumably causing their increased spatial memory.

Albert Einstein’s brain did not reveal the secret of his genius. But it did show that the brain area devoted to his left fingers had expanded – forming a giant fold in his cortex called the Omega sign, shaped like the Greek symbol – all thanks to his less commonly known passion for playing the violin.

This fold becomes enlarged in experienced violin players, who intensively develop fine dexterity with the fingers of their left hand. Piano players, in contrast, develop an Omega sign in both hemispheres, as they use both hands in fine, detailed movements

everything you’ve experienced has altered the physical structure of your brain – from the expression of genes to the positions of molecules to the architecture of neurons. Your family of origin, your culture, your friends, your work, every movie you’ve watched, every conversation you’ve had – these have all left their footprints in your nervous system. These indelible, microscopic impressions accumulate to make you who you are, and to constrain who you can become.

#### Pathological Changes:

the amygdala, which is involved in fear and aggression.

your brain can alter the fabric of who you are. Consider the ingestion of drugs or alcohol. Particular kinds of epilepsy make people more religious. Parkinson’s disease often makes people lose their faith, while the medication for Parkinson’s can often turn people into compulsive gamblers.

everything contributes to a continual reshaping of the neural networks we summarize as us

#### Am I the sum of my memories?

Every four months your red blood cells are entirely replaced, for instance, and your skin cells are replaced every few weeks. Within about seven years every atom in your body will be replaced by other atoms.

Perhaps memory can serve as the thread that makes you who you are. It sits at the core of your identity, providing a single, continuous sense of self.

Everything you experience triggers particular patterns of activity in your brain.

Your neurons operate in a dynamic matrix of shifting relationships, and heavy demand is continually placed on them to wire with others. So your memory of the birthday dinner has become muddied, as those “birthday” neurons have been co-opted to participate in other memory networks. The enemy of memory isn’t time; it’s other memories.

a faded memory doesn’t seem faded to you. You feel, or at least assume, that the full picture is there.

So a single event may be perceived somewhat differently by you at different stages in your life.

#### The Fallablity of Memory

leading questions could contaminate memory

it possible to implant false new memories in the brain, but people embraced and embel- bished them, unknowingly weaving fantasy into the fabric of their identity.

Our past is not a faithful record. Instead it's a reconstruction, and sometimes it can border on mythology.

When we review our life memories, we should do so with the awareness that not all the details are accurate. Some came from stories that people told us about ourselves; others were filled in with what we thought must've happened.

#### The Aging Brain

psychological distress were related to more rapid cognitive decline. Positive traits like Conscientiousness, purpose in life, and keeping busy were protective

The more we keep our brains cognitively fit-typically by challenging them with difficult and novel tasks, including social interaction- the more the neural networks build new roadways to get from A to B.

even if many path- ways degenerate because of disease, the brain can retrieve other solutions.

#### Brains are Like Snowflakes:

what I think we can say: the meaning of something to you is all about your webs of associations, based on the whole history of your life experiences,

You don't perceive objects as they are You perceive them as you are.

As your trillions of new connections continually form and re-form, the distinctive pattern means that no one like you has ever existed, or will ever exist
