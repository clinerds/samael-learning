# Peace in Chaos

> Today Sunday 06-08-2023 Something Happened, I felt Something. I felt Peace. It's not Weird that I felt peace, The weird thing is that I felt peace in chaos. The chaos happening in other people's lives, it gave me a sense of comfort like a cozy blanket of superiority. I felt powerful, Genius, Magnificent. It gave me a sense of comfort knowing that the peoples I hate are below me and I am above them in all sense.
