#### Summary

The Coolidge Effect is a subconscious program in the brain that drives sexual excitement and addiction, which is exploited by internet porn. It is a genetic program aimed at increasing the genetic variety of offspring. The effect involves declining interest in a current sexual partner and renewed vigor with a novel partner. This phenomenon is observed in all mammals, including humans. The limbic system, also known as the mammal brain, is the part of the brain where this program is installed and governs emotions, desires, and sexual urges.

#### Highlights

- 🐀 The Coolidge Effect is demonstrated through an experiment with male rats, where they lose interest in a female rat after mating repeatedly but regain excitement with a new partner.
- 📊 The Coolidge Effect is also observed in rams, as shown in an experiment where they took longer to ejaculate with the same female but ejaculated quickly with different females.
- 💻 Heavy porn users require more novelty to maintain excitement, similar to the animals experiencing the Coolidge Effect.
- 🐒 Monkeys in a study were willing to give up fruit juice to view female monkey bottoms, resembling a behavior similar to porn.
- 🧠 The limbic system, or mammal brain, is where the old program of the Coolidge Effect is installed and controls emotions, desires, and sexual urges.
- 💕 The Coolidge Effect influences individuals' sexual behavior, even in committed relationships, as the primitive brain urges them to seek novel sexual stimuli.
- 🧬 The purpose of the Coolidge Effect is to increase the genetic variety of offspring and spread one's genes.
- 📺 Internet porn takes advantage of the Coolidge Effect by stimulating the primitive brain's desire for sexual novelty.
- 🚫 Sexual desire or libido is not solely located in the genitals but experienced in the limbic system, where the Coolidge Effect occurs.
- 🔒 Understanding the Coolidge Effect helps shed light on the mechanisms of porn addiction and other addictions that stem from the primitive brain
