#HumanFuturePrediction #Hypothesis #Imagination​
Humanity is at a tipping point:​ ​​​ ​We stand at a crossroads of accelerating change​ ​​​ ​unlike anything ever seen in the history of life.​ ​​​ ​It feels as if the future could tip either way.​ ​​​ ​Between utopia​ ​​​ ​and apocalypse.​ ​​​ ​The risks we face are daunting.​ ​​​ ​But beneath the rampant pessimism for our future​ ​​​ ​is evidence that humanity​ ​​​ ​can not only survive the coming centuries,​ ​​​ ​but thrive deep into the future.​ ​​​ ​No one knows what comes next.​ ​​​ ​But there are three broad paths​ ​​​ ​our future could take.​ ​​​ ​

The first is Collapse:​ ​​​ ​a major catastrophe threatens the downfall of civilization​ ​​​ ​and possibly even extinction of the human race.​ ​​​ ​Second is​ ​​​ ​Plateau:​ ​​​ ​where mankind averts collapse,​ ​​​ ​but hits an upper limit of progress.​ ​​​ ​And third is​ ​​​ ​Transcendence:​ ​​​ ​where humanity reaches its full potential,​ ​​​ ​multiplies into the trillions,​ ​​​ ​or transforms along the way into something entirely​ ​​​ ​unimaginable.​ ​​​ ​Envisioning these futures​ ​​​ ​will clarify the risks we face,​ ​​​ ​and the promise we have,​ ​​​ ​as we step into an unpredictable new era,​ ​​​ ​for planet Earth,​ ​​​ ​and for ourselves.​ ​​​ ​

Mankind is no stranger to catastrophe.​ ​​​ ​Our ancestors have survived asteroid impacts,​ ​​​ ​ice ages,​ ​​​ ​supervolcano eruptions,​ ​​​ ​and deadly plagues,​ ​​​ ​each time bouncing back to new heights.​ ​​​ ​But our biggest threats​ ​​​ ​no longer come from the natural world...​ ​​​ ​they come from ourselves.​ ​​​ ​Since the dawn of nuclear weapons,​ ​​​ ​the threats of self-destruction​ ​​​ ​have come to dwarf all others.​ ​​​ ​By some estimates,​ ​​​ ​the risk of causing our own extinction​ ​​​ ​is over 300 times higher​ ​​​ ​than extinction by natural causes.​ ​​​ ​

The Future of Life institute​ ​​​ ​identifies 4 main risks to our survival​ ​​​ ​Nuclear War,​ ​​​ ​Climate Change,​ ​​​ ​Biotechnology,​ ​​​ ​and A.I.​ ​​​ ​To comprehend the gravity of these risks,​ ​​​ ​we have to envision their worst possible outcomes.​ ​​​ ​The soot from a large-scale nuclear war​ ​​​ ​could cool global temperatures​ ​​​ ​by nearly 10 degrees​ ​​​ ​and wipe out up to 63% of the population.​ ​​​ ​

We have made strides in reducing nuclear stockpiles,​ ​​​ ​but there are nearly 10 000 warheads​ ​​​ ​still in existence.​ ​​​ ​Currently, we are on track to heat the earth​ ​​​ ​by around 2.7 degrees by 2100,​ ​​​ ​which could displace over a billion people.​ ​​​ ​But in the worst case,​ ​​​ ​we could trigger C02 tipping points​ ​​​ ​and could cause up to 12 degrees of warming​ ​​​ ​in the coming centuries.​ ​​​ ​Biotechnology has the potential​ ​​​ ​to solve major crises​ ​​​ ​like food scarcity and disease,​ ​​​ ​but could give small groups of people​ ​​​ ​the power to cause global disaster.​ ​​​ ​In theory,​ ​​​ ​the release of a designer pathogen​ ​​​ ​could have an even higher death toll​ ​​​ ​than a global nuclear war.​ ​​​ ​

But the hardest risk to gauge stems from A.I.​ ​​​ ​It’s the first threat we’ve faced​ ​​​ ​that we may not be able to out-smart.​ ​​​ ​It could become a powerful ally​ ​​​ ​or it could ultimately outcompete us​ ​​​ ​for the world’s resources​ ​​​ ​and push humanity into obscurity.​ ​​​ ​Navigating this new risk landscape​ ​​​ ​will be the biggest challenge we have yet faced.​ ​​​ ​And new, unknown threats​ ​​​ ​are bound to materialize the more we progress.​ ​​​ ​But despite the potential​ ​​​ ​for large-scale human tragedy,​ ​​​ ​few of these risks on their own​ ​​​ ​are likely to lead to our total extinction.​ ​​​ ​In fact,​ ​​​ ​we may be one of the least endangered species​ ​​​ ​on Earth.​ ​​​

​Our sheer numbers and broad distribution​ ​​​ ​have given us a geographical buffer against extinction.​ ​​​ ​We inhabit every corner of the Earth,​ ​​​ ​from desert to tundra​ ​​​ ​and tiny isolated islands,​ ​​​ ​which could act as natural quarantines.​ ​​​ ​in case of global disaster.​ ​​​ ​Even if 99.9% of humans​ ​​​ ​were eliminated in some catastrophe​ ​​​ ​8 million of us would remain,​ ​​​ ​more than existed for most of our history.​ ​​​ ​And although we are slow to reproduce,​ ​​​ ​we no longer rely on the glacial pace​ ​​​ ​of natural selection to adapt.​ ​​​ ​Technology gives us the power​ ​​​ ​to adapt thousands of times faster​ ​​​ ​than any other species in the history of life.​ ​​​ ​

Lastly,​ ​​​ ​our generalist diets allow for a wide flexibility​ ​​​ ​in food sources,​ ​​​ ​a trait that was critical to survivors​ ​​​ ​of past mass extinctions.​ ​​​ ​Ultimately,​ ​​​ ​the threat of collapse hinges on one question:​ ​​​ ​how resilient is civilization?​ ​​​ ​How big of a hit can we take,​ ​​​ ​and keep going?​ ​​​ ​The black death of 1347​ ​​​ ​killed up to half the population of Europe​ ​​​ ​and 1/10th of people globally.​ ​​​ ​But even this did not derail human progress…​ ​​​ ​and it was followed by the scientific revolution​ ​​​ ​just two hundred years later.​ ​​​ ​The same proportional hit today​ ​​​ ​would wreak havoc on our​ ​​​ ​inner connected global economy.​ ​​​ ​But as long as our infrastructure​ ​​​ ​and knowledge remained,​ ​​​ ​we could still rebound and maintain​ ​​​ ​an upward momentum.​ ​​​ ​

If we suffered a collapse steep enough​ ​​​ ​to extinguish global industry,​ ​​​ ​it would make for a much longer,​ ​​​ ​more precarious recovery.​ ​​​ ​And If we somehow lost the capability for agriculture,​ ​​​ ​and were pushed back to hunter-gatherer lifestyles,​ ​​​ ​the Earth could only support 10 million of us,​ ​​​ ​our population as it was a hundred centuries ago.​ ​​​ ​At minimum,​ ​​​ ​there would need to be​ ​​​ ​between a 100 and 5000 survivors​ ​​​ ​to successfully repopulate the Earth​ ​​​ ​Below that level,​ ​​​ ​the bottleneck would be too tight,​ ​​​ ​and we might never recover.​ ​​​ ​To comprehend what’s at stake,​ ​​​ ​we have to confront what extinction​ ​​​ ​would actually mean.​ ​​​ ​

Our greatest threat​ ​​​ ​comes not from a single disastrous event,​ ​​​ ​but from the compounding effects of disasters​ ​​​ ​that overlap and mix together​ ​​​ ​in unpredictable ways.​ ​​​ ​In 2009​ ​​​ ​two researchers conducted a thought experiment​ ​​​ ​to see what it would take to drive humanity​ ​​​ ​to complete extinction.​ ​​​ ​Phase I​ ​​​ ​sees a rapid crash in human population​ ​​​ ​from global warfare​ ​​​ ​and collapse of global industry​ ​​​ ​and agriculture.​ ​​​ ​Phase II​ ​​​ ​sees the exhaustion of remaining natural resources​ ​​​ ​over the following two centuries.​ ​​​ ​And Phase III​ ​​​ ​envisions a downward spiral​ ​​​ ​of ecosystem collapse,​ ​​​ ​punctuated by a supervolcano eruption,​ ​​​ ​leaving the last remaining bands of humanity​ ​​​ ​unable to cling on any longer.​ ​​​ 

​Such an outcome would not only be tragic​ ​​​ ​for the loss of life,​ ​​​ ​but for the loss of future potential life.​ ​​​ ​Billions or even trillions​ ​​​ ​of our potential descendants​ ​​​ ​would never materialize.​ ​​​ ​Distant planets would go unexplored.​ ​​​ ​It would mark the end of​ ​​​ ​music, poetry, and art​ ​​​ ​in our corner of the galaxy,​ ​​​ ​and possibly in the entire universe.​ ​​​ ​The Svalbard Global Seed Bank in Norway​ ​​​ ​now holds over a million seed specimens​ ​​​ ​for over 4 000 species of plant,​ ​​​ ​which could someday be a critical resource​ ​​​ ​for rebuilding civilization.​ ​​​ ​But there’s an even better place​ ​​​ ​to build a vault like this.​ ​​​ ​Some have proposed lunar arks​ ​​​ ​that would store genetic samples in lava tubes​ ​​​ ​beneath the moon’s surface.​ ​​​ ​

Here,​ ​​​ ​they would be protected from global disaster,​ ​​​ ​erosion, micrometeorites, and solar radiation.​ ​​​ ​But the best way​ ​​​ ​to secure our long-term survival​ ​​​ ​is to take the leap​ ​​​ ​that no other life form has ever taken:​ ​​​ ​to become a multiplanetary species.​ ​​​ ​Once a self-sustaining civilization​ ​​​ ​is establishedon another planet,​ ​​​ ​the chances of our extinction will plummet.​ ​​​ ​We will carry our flaws with us,​ ​​​ ​and we will face new and unknown risks​ ​​​ ​the further we stray from Earth,​ ​​​ ​but it will be worth it.​ ​​​ ​a sustainable, interplanetary civilization​ ​​​ ​will be the foundation​ ​​​ ​for a long and prosperous future.​ ​​​ ​But is this higher future actually in reach,​ ​​​ ​or are we at the peak of our powers?​ ​​​ ​How far can we go?​ ​​​ ​In theory,​ ​​​ ​it’s possible that civilization​ ​​​ ​will hold the status quo​ ​​​ ​for the indefinite future,​ ​​​ ​avoiding both collapse​ ​​​ ​and transformation.​ ​​​ ​

There could be unforeseen barriers​ ​​​ ​that keep us in a kind of uneasy stasis.​ ​​​ ​But in reality,​ ​​​ ​Plateau will be a temporary state at best.​ ​​​ ​In the short-term,​ ​​​ ​exponential changes in technology and Earth’s climate​ ​​​ ​will force civilization into new directions.​ ​​​ ​And the further we push into the future,​ ​​​ ​the greater the disruptions we will face.​ ​​​ ​In the next few hundred thousand years,​ ​​​ ​we are due to face supervolcano eruptions​ ​​​ ​and a new ice age,​ ​​​ ​even if we burn every ounce of fossil fuels​ ​​​ ​and bake the Earth.​ ​​​ ​Without active climate management,​ ​​​ ​the glaciers will have their revenge,​ ​​​ ​as mile thick sheets of ice​ ​​​ ​steamroll huge swaths of North America and Europe.​ ​​​

​It’s believed​ ​​​ ​that around every 27 million years,​ ​​​ ​Earth experiences a cyclical mass extinction,​ ​​​ ​caused by the sun passing through the​ ​​​ ​asteroid-dense middle region of our galaxy.​ ​​​ ​And around a billion years from now,​ ​​​ ​the brightening of the sun​ ​​​ ​will make Earth too hot for photosynthesis,​ ​​​ ​and the oceans will slowly boil away,​ ​​​ ​snuffing out all life on our planet.​ ​​​ ​Modern civilization will not survive these events​ ​​​ ​without a deep transformation.​ ​​​ ​One option will be to let​ ​​​ ​nature run its course on Earth,​ ​​​ ​and move to off world habitats.​ ​​​ ​Bishop Rings are circular megastructures​ ​​​ ​that could house over a billion people.​ ​​​ ​They could provide over 3 million​ ​​​ ​square kilometers of land,​ ​​​ ​as much as India or Argentina.​ ​​​

​They could be built with​ ​​​ ​lightweight carbon nanotubes,​ ​​​ ​and their rotation would generate enough gravity​ ​​​ ​to hold their own atmosphere.​ ​​​ ​But if we decide to stay Earth-bound,​ ​​​ ​we are not at the mercy of our planet.​ ​​​ ​We have the power to write its future.​ ​​​ ​Despite all the dangers we face,​ ​​​ ​utopian futures are well within reach​ ​​​ ​and sooner than we might think.​ ​​​ 

​To our ancestors,​ ​​​ ​our current powers would appear god-like.​ ​​​ ​But everything we have achieved so far​ ​​​ ​may pale in comparison​ ​​​ ​to what comes next.​ ​​​ ​Since the industrial revolution,​ ​​​ ​technological progress has been radically improving​ ​​​ ​the human condition in every critical way.​ ​​​ ​Worldwide,​ ​​​ ​quality of life is at an all time high.​ ​​​ ​We don’t perceive​ ​​​ ​these positive trends as clearly​ ​​​ ​due to our negativity bias,​ ​​​ ​which evolved to make us​ ​​​ ​extra attentive to negative information.​ ​​​ ​But the forward momentum is undeniable.​ ​​​ 

​Our course correction​ ​​​ ​to a sustainable civilization​ ​​​ ​now appears unstoppable.​ ​​​ ​The costs of solar and wind energy​ ​​​ ​are falling faster than expert predictions,​ ​​​ ​making them often cheaper than fossil fuels.​ ​​​ ​At the same time,​ ​​​ ​converging advancements in A.I. and biotech​ ​​​ ​are pointing toward a radical enhancement​ ​​​ ​of human well being.​ ​​​ ​

Already,​ ​​​ ​projects like AlphaFold​ ​​​ ​are discovering structures​ ​​​ ​of pathogens and treatments for cancer​ ​​​ ​far faster than humans could.​ ​​​ ​There are over 10,000 diseases​ ​​​ ​that are caused by single gene mutations​ ​​​ ​and gene editing tools like CRISPR​ ​​​ ​have the potential to cure all of them.​ ​​​ ​These upward trends are multiplying​ ​​​ ​the human potential many times over.​ ​​​ ​We are now the healthiest,​ ​​​ ​wealthiest,​ ​​​ ​freest,​ ​​​ ​most educated,​ ​​​ ​most advanced population​ ​​​ ​of humans to ever exist.​ ​​​ ​If these trends hold,​ ​​​ ​we could gain the power to regenerate limbs,​ ​​​ ​eliminate all disease,​ ​​​ ​and possibly extend our life spans​ ​​​ ​indefinitely.​ ​​​ ​putting us on the brink​ ​​​ ​of the most radical transformation​ ​​​ ​in our history.​ ​​​ ​

Achieving these breakthroughs​ ​​​ ​will require technological leaps​ ​​​ ​that the human mind alone cannot make.​ ​​​ ​But already,​ ​​​ ​NASA has begun to use AI​ ​​​ ​to design mission hardware,​ ​​​ ​outperforming human designs by a factor of three.​ ​​​ ​It’s also being pioneered​ ​​​ ​in the development of cleaner biofuels​ ​​​ ​and drought-resistant crops,​ ​​​ ​which could be critical​ ​​​ ​in the fight against climate change.​ ​​​ ​And this is just the start.​ ​​​ 

​We are witnessing the beginning​ ​​​ ​of an intelligence explosion.​ ​​​ ​which could lead to an​ ​​​ ​Artificial Super Intelligence​ ​​​ ​that far exceeds human capabilities.​ ​​​ ​able to solve complex problems​ ​​​ ​have have defied humanity.​ ​​​ ​Aligning it to human values​ ​​​ ​will be a huge and novel challenge.​ ​​​ ​But it will be a vital step.​ ​​​ ​Not just for the enormous prosperity it could bring,​ ​​​ ​but to counter the threat​ ​​​ ​of malicious AIs​ ​​​ ​A safely aligned super intelligence​ ​​​ ​should be a prime objective​ ​​​ ​for human progress.​ ​​​ ​If we can safely harness the power of AI​ ​​​ ​for human betterment,​ ​​​ ​then we can paint a utopian future​ ​​​ ​our ancestors could hardly fathom.​ ​​​ ​

A future free of disease and hunger,​ ​​​ ​where biotechnology has stabilized​ ​​​ ​the climate and biodiversity.​ ​​​ ​Where abundant clean energy​ ​​​ ​is developed in concert with AI;​ ​​​ ​Where breakthroughs in​ ​​​ ​rocketry and materials sciences​ ​​​ ​have propelled humans​ ​​​ ​to distant planets and moons;​ ​​​ ​And where new tools​ ​​​ ​for artistic and musical expression​ ​​​ ​open new frontiers of beauty,​ ​​​ ​experience, and understanding.​ ​​​ ​And all of this could be just the prologue​ ​​​ ​to an even grander future.​ ​​​ ​If our energy use​ ​​​ ​continues its exponential growth,​ ​​​ ​we could eventually control more energy​ ​​​ ​than the Earth it self receives,​ ​​​ ​becoming a Type 1 Civilization.​ ​​​ ​

A recent study shows​ ​​​ ​this could occur as soon as the year 2371.​ ​​​ ​And by maintaining 3% yearly growth,​ ​​​ ​we would reach Type 2​ ​​​ ​in just a few thousand years.​ ​​​ ​Able to control all the energy​ ​​​ ​from the sun.​ ​​​ ​If our species survives​ ​​​ ​until the death of the sun​ ​​​ ​in 5 billion years,​ ​​​ ​it could lead to the existence of​ ​​​ ​some 600 quadrillion people.​ ​​​ ​And by colonizing space,​ ​​​ ​vastly more still could come into existence,​ ​​​ ​something like​ ​​​ ​a hundred​ ​​​ ​a hundred thousand​ ​​​ ​a hundred thousand trillion​ ​​​ ​a hundred thousand trillion trillion​ ​​​ ​a hundred thousand trillion trillion people​ ​​​ ​in the milky way.​ ​​​ ​But the farther we spread​ ​​​ ​into space and time,​ ​​​ ​the more different we will become.​ ​​​ ​It’s possible​ ​​​ ​that we will splinter into multiple species,​ ​​​ ​each with a different tolerance for change.​ ​​​ ​

Some may choose to merge​ ​​​ ​with our machines​ ​​​ ​into a new hybrid species,​ ​​​ ​rejecting natural selection​ ​​​ ​in favor of technological evolution.​ ​​​ ​While others may choose​ ​​​ ​to remain fully biological.​ ​​​ ​This splintering would mark the first time​ ​​​ ​since the Neanderthals​ ​​​ ​more than one human-like species walked the Earth.​ ​​​ ​And if we ever come to digitize​ ​​​ ​our consciousness,​ ​​​ ​human identity could branch​ ​​​ ​into an infinite number of varieties.​ ​​​ ​

As we grow into new,​ ​​​ ​more powerful forms,​ ​​​ ​we will eventually have to confront​ ​​​ ​a profound question:​ ​​​ ​what is our ultimate purpose in the universe?​ ​​​ ​We could aim for the lofty goal​ ​​​ ​of colonizing the entire galaxy,​ ​​​ ​of becoming a type 3 civilization​ ​​​ ​and reordering the milky way​ ​​​ ​to our own designs.​ ​​​ ​We could aim to outlive the stars themselves,​ ​​​ ​in some one hundred trillion years.​ ​​​ ​But these far-off dreams​ ​​​ ​are not for us to realize.​ ​​​

​If they are ever achieved,​ ​​​ ​it will be by some distant descendant of ours,​ ​​​ ​evolved far beyond their human roots.​ ​​​ ​Instead,​ ​​​ ​perhaps humanity’s ultimate goal​ ​​​ ​should be a more personal one:​ ​​​ ​to save the Earth,​ ​​​ ​he little rocky planet where it all began.​ ​​​ ​By pulling Earth away from the expanding sun,​ ​​​ ​we could prolong the game of life​ ​​​ ​by billions of years.​ ​​​ ​This could be done​ ​​​ ​by building a giant conductive counterweight​ ​​​ ​on the far side of the moon.​ ​​​ ​The process would take millions of years.​ ​​​ ​

But it would be a truly worthy goal,​ ​​​ ​to offset the destruction we have caused​ ​​​ ​and keep life flourishing for eons more.​ ​​​ ​A final act​ ​​​ ​of redemption for humanity.​ ​​​ ​Only the worst-case scenarios can stop us.​ ​​​ ​If we can avoid them,​ ​​​ ​we have the potential​ ​​​ ​to seed a vast new branch of life​ ​​​ ​that could outgrow Earth itself​ ​​​ ​and spread across the universe.​ ​​​ ​If there is one lesson​ ​​​ ​our history can teach us,​ ​​​ ​it’s to never underestimate​ ​​​ ​the human race.​ ​​​ ​
