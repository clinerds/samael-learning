Your cerebrum is the largest part of your [[Human Brain]]  and it handles a wide range of responsibilities. Located at the front and top of your skull, it gets its name from the Latin word meaning “brain.”

Your cerebrum is instrumental in everything you do in day-to-day life, ranging from thoughts to actions. In essence, it’s responsible for the brain functions that allow us to interact with our environment and make us who we are.

Scientists have been studying the brain for years, trying to unlock just how it works and how to diagnose and treat conditions that affect it. While experts know a lot about how the cerebrum works, there’s much that’s not fully understood. Fortunately, advances in technology and medical science have helped drive growth in what experts understand about the brain.

## What Does it Do?

- **Behavior and personality**: As a part of cerebrum comes into [[Frontal Lobe]], it's responsible for  emotions, behavior and personality

- **Short Term Memory:** Cerebrum is also responsible for short term memory (Maybe that's why when a concussion occurs at the back of the head, there is a short term memory loss)

- **Five Senses:** Cerebrum is also responsible of managing the five senses, including hearing, tasting, seeing (as occipital lobe is a part of cerebrum), touching, smelling.

- **Movement:** Certain areas of cerebrum sends signals to your muscles to tell them what to do when you use them

- **Language:** Various part of cerebrum handles your ability to read, write and speak

- **Learning, Logic and Reasoning:**  Different areas of your cerebrum work together when you need to learn a new skill, make a plan of action or puzzle out a problem.
