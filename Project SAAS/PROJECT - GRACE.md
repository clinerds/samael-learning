#Project #Saas #CustomDevelopment #AI 


# Change Of Plans

Instead of using a no code tool I think i should do the custom development, because no code tools are 

- expensive
- I don't have the development control
- have to pay them on yearly or monthly basis (another expense)

but if I do the custom development I Will get the full control over my product, i can also look fro ways to host it for free. plus, there is only one expense which is hosting and domain.

# To Do

- Use react and necessary framework to build UI
- use open routers API to get mistral 7b and develop a prototype or train your own model on custom data and host it to huggingface as an API and use that API
- find a way to save memory
- Launch

P.S: for further modification I can train my models on custom data (somehow without GPU) and host it to huggingface to get the API, and then integrate it with my app.
